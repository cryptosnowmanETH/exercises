#Given 2 ints, a and b, return True if one if them is 10 or if their sum is 10.


makes10(9, 10) → True
makes10(9, 9) → False
makes10(1, 9) → True

#Given a string, return a new string where "not " has been added to the front. However, if the string already begins with "not", return the string unchanged.


not_string('candy') → 'not candy'
not_string('x') → 'not x'
not_string('not bad') → 'not bad'


Given a non-empty string and an int n, return a new string where the char at index n has been removed. The value of n will be a valid index of a char in the original string (i.e. n will be in the range 0..len(str)-1 inclusive).


missing_char('kitten', 1) → 'ktten'
missing_char('kitten', 0) → 'itten'
missing_char('kitten', 4) → 'kittn'


Given a string, return a new string where the first and last chars have been exchanged.


front_back('code') → 'eodc'
front_back('a') → 'a'
front_back('ab') → 'ba'

ront3('Java') → 'JavJavJav'
front3('Chocolate') → 'ChoChoCho'
front3('abc') → 'abcabcabc'


Capital indexes
Write a function named capital_indexes. The function takes a single parameter, which is a string. Your function should return a list of all the indexes in the string that have capital letters.

For example, calling capital_indexes("HeLlO") should return the list [0, 2, 4].


Write a function named mid that takes a string as its parameter. Your function should extract and return the middle letter. If there is no middle letter, your function should return the empty string.

For example, mid("abc") should return "b" and mid("aaaa") should return "".


Online status
The aim of this challenge is, given a dictionary of people's online status, to count the number of people who are online.

For example, consider the following dictionary:

statuses = {
    "Alice": "online",
    "Bob": "offline",
    "Eve": "online",
}
In this case, the number of people online is 2.

Write a function named online_count that takes one parameter. The parameter is a dictionary that maps from strings of names to the string "online" or "offline", as seen above.

Your function should return the number of people who are online.



Challenge
Type check
Write a function named only_ints that takes two parameters. Your function should return True if both parameters are integers, and False otherwise.

For example, calling only_ints(1, 2) should return True, while calling only_ints("a", 1) should return False.


Flatten a list
Write a function that takes a list of lists and flattens it into a one-dimensional list.

Name your function flatten. It should take a single parameter and return a list.

For example, calling:

flatten([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
Should return the list:

[1, 2, 3, 4]
